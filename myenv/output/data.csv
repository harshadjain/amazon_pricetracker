Almost perfect at 55k, 11 December 2021,3.0,"This is a great laptop, mostly due to the Thinkpad chassis and AMD's Zen3 processor. The E14 gen.3 actually has a better keyboard than higher end Thinkpads due to a design change on the latter. Unlike the 8-core model, the soldered RAM configuration is also spot-on for 16GB of dual-channel operation (though it can support a max. of 24). Thinkpad reliability/durability is legendary and hopefully Lenovo doesn't mess to much with the old IBM DNA going forward.Now for things that aren't so great like the TN display; on Lenovo's website, an upgrade to the base IPS panel costs just ~1.5k extra. Given the vastly superior screen for such a small increase in price, it is a ridiculous decision to select this display on a 50k+ laptop. The battery pack should also be larger; again a very small increase in price over the relative cost of the system. This loses it two stars that could have easily been retained."
"I had to go to Lenovo store and buy the product because, it doesn't have an IPS display available.", 10 November 2021,5.0,"- Bought a customized Thinkpad from lenovo store and it costed around 63k- Dos version, Ryzen 5,with fingerprint, 100 RGB display, backlight,512GB,8GB RAM.Only con had to wait for a month."

"Good laptop, but horrible TN panel", 17 October 2021,4.0,"Seriously lenovo, can't you spend $10 more on an IPS display? A 220nits TN panel in 2021 is unacceptable, especially in a business laptop. I'll probably end up changing the LCD panel myself."
Thinkpad Legacy, 11 November 2021,4.0,"In the days of MacBooks and Ultrabooks, thinkpads are a niche. Saying that The third gen e14 with 5600u performs exceptionally well for what is expected. I am writer and the keyboard is just amazing (3 gen is backlit). Unlike other laptops which have traded good key travel for ultrabook specs, this is a delight to have. Yes the screen is TN panel which is a con for this laptop but and gives me decent 5hrs of battery life. The Upgradability  is high with RAM (8gb soldered + empty slot) and storage (2 NVME slots). The selling point is the build quality of laptop which is on par or high compared to laptops worth twice it’s price. The Ryzen 5600u runs with full muscle defeating desktop level cpus given the laptop did not comprise of cooling for its thick footprint. Overall it’s a great pick if your are coder, music producer / do or a writer."
Versatile mean tough machine., 20 October 2021,5.0,When it comes to dependability Thinkpad is the only machine which fits in for the ruggedness at an affordable pricing. The earlier Thinkpad was a heavier one remained with me for little over 7 years. Weathered hot and dusty summers. Sure that the new sleeker will be as much dependable. Worth buying
Awesome laptop.. great performance.., 12 November 2021,5.0,"Everything very fine. Except for Camera. Also, screen viewing angles aren’t too good. But it is hell of a performance master. Runs very very smooth."
